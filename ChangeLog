	* xs/GnomeVFSDirectory.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSXfer.xs: Follow muppet's advise: Don't use ALIAS
	sections to "rename" functions but do it the manly way instead.
	We now don't have two xsubs for those functions anymore but we
	also lose a bit of C API compatability.  Considering the very high
	stinkage factor of that API, that's not necessarily a bad thing
	though.

	* vfs2perl.h
	* xs/GnomeVFSFileInfo.xs: repair bits of the patch that got out
	of sync.  works properly on gnome 2.0 now.

2003/11/25 23:04 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* vfs2perl.h
	* xs/GnomeVFSFileInfo.xs: Apply muppet's patch to work around the
	fact that some older versions of gnome-vfs shipped with a
	definition of GnomeVFSFilePermissions that glib-mkenums doesn't
	recognize as a GFlags aspirant.

2003/11/25 00:15 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	R vfs2perl.typemap
	A vfs.typemap

	* xs/GnomeVFSAsync.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSDirectory.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSXfer.xs: Don't declare variables in CODE or PPCODE
	sections, use PREINIT instead.

2003/11/23 21:52 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* Makefile.PL: Use custom prefixes for all GEnums and GFlags so
	that there are no conflicts if/when gnome-vfs starts creating its
	own ones. (muppet)

	* examples/downloader.pl: Use mnemonics and provide better status
	messages.

	* t/GnomeVFSFileInfo.t: Don't test matches by fetching the info
	from the same file twice but by comparing one info to itself.  The
	reason it was only working on my machine but not on others was
	that I had access time storage disabled. (Ross McFarland)

	* t/GnomeVFSUtils.t: Skip the make_uri_canonical test on versions
	older than 2.1.0. (muppet)

	* xs/GnomeVFS.xs: Remove FIXME comments.

	* xs/GnomeVFSAsync.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSDirectory.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSURI.xs: Use standard GBoxed wrappers instead of the
	homebrew HV + magic thingies.  There's less code duplication and
	better documentation now.  A potentially negative side effect is
	that you can't store additional data inside the Perl objects
	anymore.  The change necessitated the creation and registration of
	GTypes for those structs, too. (muppet, for suggesting this step)

	* xs/GnomeVFSAsync.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSDirectory.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSXfer.xs: Stick to the standard GPerlCallback
	marshalling wherever possible.

2003/11/18 23:36 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* examples/downloader.pl: Handle a click on Download with nothing

	* Makefile.PL: Remove dependency checking for Gtk2.

	* VFS.pm: Don't 'use Gtk2;', 'use Glib;'.  We don't depend on
	Gtk2.  Add an import method that takes an '-init' parameter, in
	the style of Gtk2.

	* t/GnomeVFSAsync: Do 'use Gtk2 -init;' here since VFS.pm isn't
	doing it anymore.

	A examples/downloader.pl: Add an example that makes use of

	A .cvsignore, xs/.cvsignore: added

2003/11/01 13:24 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* xs/GnomeVFSUtils.xs: Apply muppet's patch to make it compile on
	older versions of gnome-vfs.

	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs: Remove Gnome2::VFS::DESTROY.  It wasn't
	necessary, there are no objects with that package name.

	* xs/GnomeVFSApplicationRegistry.xs: Move
	gnome_vfs_application_registry_sync,
	gnome_vfs_application_registry_shutdown and
	gnome_vfs_application_registry_reload to the correct package.

	* xs/GnomeVFS.xs: Implement Gnome2::VFS::check_version.

	* t/GnomeVFSUtils.t: Add tests for undocumented functions.  Skip
	tests if the correspoinding function isn't available.

	* t/GnomeVFSApplicationRegistry: Add -> reload() at the beginning
	and -> shutdown() at the end.

	* Makefile.PL: Require version 1.01 of Glib for the new
	T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER typemap.

	* vfs2perl.typemap: Switch to T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER for all
	types.

	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSURI.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSXfer.xs: Use newRV_noinc instead of newRV_inc or
	newRV all over the place to plug some biiiig memory leaks.  The
	extra reference count incrementation prevented the destruction
	handlers from being called at all.

	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs: Use gnome_vfs_file_info_unref instead of
	g_free to free GnomeVFSFileInfo's.

	* xs/GnomeVFSURI.xs: Use gnome_vfs_uri_unref on the URI upon
	destruction of the SV.

	* xs/GnomeVFSUtils.xs: Add a CLEANUP rule to virtually every

	* vfs2perl.h
	* vfs2perl.typemap

	* xs/GnomeVFSOps.xs
	* xs/GnomeVFSFileInfo.xs: Move newSVGnomeVFSFileInfo to
	GnomeVFSFileInfo.xs.  Turn GnomeVFSFileInfo into an object so you
	can call methods on it.  Retain the hash nature of it, though.
	Yeah, it's not very OO-ish to be able to directly access the data
	of an object, but implementing and using accessors would be much
	more copious.

	* vfs2perl.typemap: Add typemaps for GnomeVFSFileInfo.

2003/10/22 01:36 (+0200) kaffeetisch

	* VFS.pm: Follow James Curbo's advice and use a non-local file in

	things, too.

2003/10/20 17:15 (+0200) kaffeetisch

	* t/GnomeVFSOps.t: Implemented Gnome2::VFS::Monitor tests.  They
	need FAM, so I don't know if it's a good idea to enable them by
	default.  Time will tell.

	* xs/GnomeVFS.xs: Implement gnome_vfs_get_version_info.

	* t/GnomeVFSURI.t: Skip resolve_relative test on versions older
	than 2.3.1.

	* xs/GnomeVFSURI.xs: Remove version check in
	gnome_vfs_uri_resolve_relative as it was pointless.
